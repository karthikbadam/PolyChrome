PolyChrome
=====

A web application framework for collaborative web browsing of both static web pages and dynamic web visualizations.
[PolyChrome is currently under development and we are rapidly improving it. Please contact [us](http://karthikbadam.azurewebsites.net) if you are interested and would like to contribute to our project in any way.]

### To build:

Prerequisites (both Windows and Unix):
    
    * Python 2.6 or 2.7  
    * Visual Studio 2010 or 2012 (Windows)
    * GCC 4.2 or newer (Unix) 
    * Node.js (http://nodejs.org/download/)
    
   
How to download:

    * git clone https://github.com/karthikbadam/PolyChrome.git

  
###How to install and run:

- PolyChrome has numerous dependencies, but thanks to npm (a package manager for node.js), they can all be installed with a single command. Open the PolyChrome folder in your command prompt or terminal and type in:


    * npm install
    
    
- This should take care of the dependencies. Note that PolyChrome is built to use [Express](http://expressjs.com/), a web application framework for node.js.
    
- Now, you can run PolyChrome using:


    * node polychrome-server.js

- PolyChrome has two server components: (1) A proxy server to handle requests from the clients (running at port 3000), and (2) a modified version of [PeerJS](http://peerjs.com/) server to handle the connections between peers/clients (running at port 8080).


###PolyChrome API modules:

- PolyChrome API is now available in _public/api/_ folder. Please take a look at the examples for reference (documentation is in progress). 
 
    * [hostname]:3000/choropleth
    * [hostname]:3000/scatterplot
    * [hostname]:3000/iris

###How to use PolyChrome:

- Open your browser and enter the url "localhost:3000" or "[hostname]:3000", depending on where you are running the server. This will open the following page:

- Note that if you want to try out PolyChrome collaboration on the same device, you have to open the above URL ("[hostname]:3000") in two different tabs, as each tab gets a unique deviceID. 

- Type in a URL in the respective space, and click the triangular icon to submit. Now, PolyChrome fetches the content of this URL by acting as a proxy, and opens it in a new window as follows:

-  The feedback panel on top right of this page, shows the details of the events being captured, and also the connected peers (highlighted).
